# **Smoosh Bros**

### A Super Smash Bros–style two-player fighting game built entirely in **SystemVerilog** on an **FPGA**  
**640×480 VGA • Hardware Sprites • Real-Time Physics • Fully Parallel Game Engine**

---

</div>

## Overview

**Smoosh Bros** is a fully hardware-accelerated fighting game implemented in **pure SystemVerilog**.  
There is **no CPU**, no firmware, and no software loop of any kind.

Every frame of gameplay is produced directly in FPGA logic:

- Movement & physics  
- Collision & platform logic  
- Hit detection  
- Shields  
- Health & stock tracking  
- Sprite animation  
- VGA rendering  

The entire game engine runs **fully in parallel**, synchronized to the VGA clock.

## Gameplay Features

### **Player Systems**
- Responsive two-player controls  
- Smooth horizontal movement with acceleration  
- Full jumping + falling animations  
- Attack system with active hit frames  
- Real-time health bars  
- Stock-based life system  
- Shield ability with decay, cooldown, and break  
- Accurate platform collision  
- Clean animation transitions:  
  *idle → walk → run → jump → fall → attack*

### **Rendering**
- **640×480 @ 60 Hz** VGA output  
- Hardware HSYNC/VSYNC generation  
- Background + platforms stored in ROM  
- Character sprites stored in block ROM  
- Alpha-style transparency masking  
- Pixel-accurate renderer composed in hardware

## How the Hardware Game Engine Works

Every frame, the game logic executes as a fully pipelined hardware system:

1. **Controller inputs** are sampled  
2. **Movement FSM** updates velocity, gravity, & position  
3. **Attack FSM** activates hitboxes and frame timing  
4. **Shield FSM** performs decay, break, and cooldown logic  
5. **Collision engine** resolves platforms & hit detection  
6. **Health/stock logic** updates player state  
7. **Animation state machine** chooses correct sprite frame  
8. **Renderer** selects pixels from background/platform/sprite/mask  
9. **VGA controller** outputs the final RGB pixel  

Everything runs **continuously and in parallel** — the FPGA *is* the game engine.

## Future Improvements

Planned extensions include:

- Directional hitboxes & variable damage  
- Special moves and projectiles  
- Additional platforms and stage layouts  
- Improved UI and hit effects  
- Hardware sound output  
- Win/results screen
